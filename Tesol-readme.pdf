## üìñ Teaching Philosophy

*(This section should contain your one-page teaching philosophy. It should articulate your beliefs about teaching and learning English, your approach to classroom management, your perspective on the role of technology, and how you aim to create an effective and inclusive learning environment.)*
My teaching philosophy is centered on creating a student-focused, communicative, and inclusive learning environment. I believe that language acquisition thrives when students are actively engaged, feel safe to take risks, and can connect what they learn to their own lives. My approach integrates technology not just as a substitute for traditional tools, but as a way to redefine tasks and foster collaboration.
